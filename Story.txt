Once upon a time there lived a monkey on a jamun tree, which was on the bank of river in a forest. In the same forest , there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kindhearted monkey offered some fruits . The crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits.
As days passed they both became friends.
